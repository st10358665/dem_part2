So when you run my application it displays a layout which will ask the user to log in if they donâ€™t have an account . After registering its then that it will be asking the user to login.
After loggin in as a lecture it will take u to the dashboard page which will be asking the lecture to submit the claim which also allows the user to upload any document to support the claim. After that the lecture can then track the claim on the claim view page.Then when the PM logs in it then take them to the approve page where they can approve or decline the claim.
And when the claim is approved or rejected it also shows in the database in the claming table as well as the view claims where the lecture can see that the claim in indeed approved.
